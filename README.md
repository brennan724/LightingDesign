# LightingDesign

This website was created during the Carlhacks 2018 hackathon for use during the spring 2018 lighting design in the theatre class.  This website calculates the appropriate distance to place a light given the height of the bars upon which lights are hung and the desired size of the pool of light on the floor.  Graphics are also provided to show the proper symbol to draw to represent the lighting fixture desired on the light plot.
